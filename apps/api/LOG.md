# Eat Out Better — Log

## 2026-06-09

### What I did
Stripped `apps/api` down to API-only. Deleted all web UI code left over from the original Next.js web frontend. Fixed Vercel build config so monorepo deploys correctly.

**Deleted:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `globals.css` — web root page and shell
- `src/app/capture/`, `processing/`, `results/` — the three web UI pages
- `src/components/` — 7 web UI components (CameraViewfinder, DishCard, etc.)
- `src/hooks/` — useAnalysis, useCamera (web versions; mobile has its own copies)
- `src/store/` — Zustand store (web version; mobile has its own copy)
- `src/lib/utils/cn.ts` — Tailwind className helper with no callers in API/lib code
- `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs` — Tailwind build config

**Modified:**
- `package.json` — removed `zustand`, `tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`, `postcss`, `@types/react-dom`
- `next.config.mjs` — removed dead `/capture` camera Permissions-Policy header
- `vercel.json` (repo root) — fixed build command (`npm run build --workspace=apps/api`) and output directory (`apps/api/.next`) so Vercel correctly builds the monorepo

### Decisions made
- Kept `react` and `react-dom` as dependencies — Next.js requires them even for API-only apps
- `src/lib/utils/format.ts` and `image.ts` were kept — they have no web UI imports and may be used by the Claude pipeline
- Vercel config fixed in `vercel.json` rather than Vercel UI setting, so it's version-controlled and reproducible

### Open questions
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` still needs to be added to Vercel environment variables before the deployed API will work
- Mobile `API_URL` env var needs to point at the live Vercel URL once deployed (currently defaults to `localhost:3000`)
- EAS build for TestFlight not yet set up

### What I did
Instrumented all 6 P0 PostHog analytics events (menu scan funnel) + P1 session linking.

**Added:**
- `apps/mobile/lib/analytics.ts` — typed event capture helpers, module-level scan session ID tracking
- `posthog-react-native` SDK installed, `PostHogProvider` wrapped in `app/_layout.tsx`

**Instrumented:**
- `menu_scan_started` → `capture.tsx` on screen mount; includes `entry_point` (cold_start vs loop_back) and `scan_session_id`
- `menu_photo_captured` → `capture.tsx` on camera capture and gallery pick; fires once per photo with running `photo_count`
- `menu_analyze_clicked` → `capture.tsx` `handleAnalyze`; passes `scan_session_id` and `startedAt` into `useAnalysis`
- `menu_analysis_completed` → `useAnalysis.ts` success path; includes `dish_count` and `analysis_duration_seconds`
- `menu_analysis_failed` → `useAnalysis.ts` all failure paths (API error, OCR empty, network error); includes `error_type` from actual error codes
- `new_scan_initiated` → `results.tsx` "Analyze New Menu" button; carries `previous_scan_session_id` and `new_scan_session_id`, navigates with `entry=loop_back&sid=<newId>` so capture picks up the right session

**Build bumped:** 3 → 4

### Decisions made
- Session ID generated in capture's `useEffect`, passed via nav params to results→capture loop so both `new_scan_initiated` and the next `menu_scan_started` share the same new session ID
- `error_type` taxonomy derived from actual code (not guessed): `NETWORK_ERROR`, `RATE_LIMIT`, `CLAUDE_ERROR`, `OCR_EMPTY`, `UNKNOWN`
- PostHog host: `https://us.i.posthog.com`

### Open questions
- QA: verify each event fires exactly once (esp. photo capture and failure paths)
- PostHog API key is hardcoded in `lib/analytics.ts` — should move to env var before public release
